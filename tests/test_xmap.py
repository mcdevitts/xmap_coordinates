"""
Tests to write:

- Interpolation with:
    - 1D spatial vectors
    - ND spatial vectors

    - 1D spatial vectors in the wrong order
    - ND spatial vectors with a different shape than the data

    - Mishaped output


- Format checks
    - Output DA
        - Right size, shape, etc
    - Input coords
        - Dimensional consistency
        - Dimensional order
        - Type

- Converting coordinates to pixels

- Add something that simplifies frequency handling between rfsystems and xarray
